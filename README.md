#  Urban Parking Dynamic Pricing Model

##  Overview

This project simulates a dynamic, real-time pricing system for 14 urban parking spaces using real-world constraints. It adjusts prices based on:
- Demand fluctuations
- Queue length
- Vehicle type
- Nearby traffic
- Special events
- Competitive pricing (nearby lots)

 The goal is to optimize utilization and revenue through intelligent, explainable pricing strategies â€” all built **from scratch** using only `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Bokeh`, and `Pathway`.
